          <h4 class="mb-3 text-dark">Pathogens in shrimp aquaculture</h4>
          <p>Pathogens in shrimp aquaculture cause $6B of loss p.a. globally. Shrimp often harbour multiple pathogens at any one time. Current single pathogen detection tests are cost prohibitive for multiple pathogens. </p>
          <p>Our solution is Shrimp <span class="font-weight-bold">Multi</span>Path. Designed at Australiaâ€™s premier research organisation CSIRO, it detects 13 pathogens of commercial relevance in a single test. Shrimp <span class="font-weight-bold">Multi</span>Path substantially reduces testing costs with superior test sensitivity, specificity, quantification and data turnaround times. Shrimp <span class="font-weight-bold">Multi</span>Path will promote the widespread use of pathogen testing as an integral tool for managing shrimp disease and transform productivity and profitability globally.</p>
