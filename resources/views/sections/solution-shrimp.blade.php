            <p class="solution-shrimp-content mr-md-5">Shrimp are often cultured as mixed un-tagged families from an early larval or post-larval age. It is mission critical in selective breeding programs to understand the pedigree of your stock as they approach reproductive age to ensure maximal genetic diversity is retained within your breeding lines. Having the option to overlay pathogen loading data with pedigree can further enhance your selection strategies. Current genetic pedigree testing services are expensive for shrimp and there are none that are coupled with highly cost effective pathogen screening.</p>

            <p class="solution-shrimp-content">Our solution is Shrimp ID. Designed at Australiaâ€™s premier research organisation CSIRO for both Pacific White shrimp (<i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>) and Black Tiger shrimp (<i>Penaeus monodon</i>). Shrimp ID panels have been trialled and tested for over 5 years on populations of Pacific White and Black Tiger shrimp from all corners of the world to determine pedigree and genetic relatedness of stocks. Shrimp ID and Shrimp <b>Multi</b>Path combined form a complementary workflow in the laboratory, resulting in highly cost effective DNA pedigree analysis.</p>
